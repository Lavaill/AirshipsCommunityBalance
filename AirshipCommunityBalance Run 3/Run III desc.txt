RUN III

[h1]The Official Airships Community Balance Mod[/h1]

This mod was created on the request of the game developer as a means to test out potential balance changes that the community would appreciate. Think of it as a balance beta!

It's rules, changes and new modules are voted on by members of the community on [url=https://discord.gg/sfQgdR] the official Discord server[/url] .

The current rules are as follow:
- The mod works in "trial runs". At the start of each run we will add all changes that were voted on and keep them in for either a determined length of time or until the community votes to end the current run.

- Two balance moderators (Orang and Towarish Broven currently) oversee the changes and have the right to veto or implement quick changes.

- At the end of the run we will vote again on each change that was implemented and make a quick report to be sent to Zarkonnen.
