[h1]The Official Airships Community Balance Mod[/h1]

This mod was created on the request of the game developer as a means to test out potential balance changes that the community would appreciate. 

It's rules, changes and new modules are voted on by members of the community on [url=https://discord.gg/sfQgdR] the official Discord server[/url] .

The current rules are as follow:
- The mod works in "trial runs". At the start of each run we will add all changes that were voted on and keep them in for either a determined length of time or until the community votes to end the current run.

- Anyone can propose a change to be tested out in the next run. If there is at least two more votes for than against at the end of the voting period, the change is eligible to be added to the mod.

- If two suggestions are incompatible (Two different values for one gun for example) only the one with the most votes will be put in the run.

- At the end of the run we will vote again on each change that was implemented and make a quick report to be sent to Zarkonnen.
